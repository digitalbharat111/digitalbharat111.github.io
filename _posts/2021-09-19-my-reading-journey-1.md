**Reading is a wonderful habit.**


Reading helps in learning a topic or a subject. It helps immerse yourself and get into a whole different world or even deep into your inner self and understand yourself better.

My Reading journey, like all children, began in school. Especially when an additional part, the Non-detail, was introduced in English subject. This subject contained short stories, and for later classes, it was a single storybook.

I got introduced to several lovely stories through this subject like The Hound of Baskervilles, The Moonstone, Trojan War and after, Guillver Travels, and a few more. 

I was thoroughly impressed by the character of Sherlock Holmes created by Arthur Conan Doyle, "The Hound of Baskervilles" was so intriguing and captivating to read through, which I read several times. Later I read a lot of books related to Sherlock Holmes, my all-time favorite detective. I am sure this character inspired many youths to become a detective.

The "Trojan War" is a book based on Greek Mythology. This book is about the greatest war the world has ever seen that had both the Gods and Men on either side. I thoroughly enjoyed the larger-than-life characters, of course, instantly became a fan of Achilles. I must have read that book several times in my school tenure. So impressed was I by this book that after around ten years of leaving school, I purchased the book from a second-hand books store and again read it several times before watching the movie "Troy" made on the same.

That interesting habit later occupied most of my free time during my Naval training and especially sailing life onboard. Read many books by Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer, John Grisham, Robert Ludlum, Dan Brown, enjoyed every book. During that time even read books of Chetan Bhagat, APJ Abdul Kalam (related)also. 

Later, a friend suggested reading fiction (Self-help as I called them) books, so I wasn't interested. He then gave me a storybook. As soon as I opened it, it took me back to my childhood days simple children's storybook. By the time I finished the book enjoying the lovely little story, I felt that it was the perfect book on change management (Who Moved my Cheese ? - Spencer Johnson)

This book changed my way of seeing life. Then started reading a different genre of books like The Present, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, The Alchemist, Fountainhead, Zahir, etc.,

My journey of reading, I believe, had just begun. I will continue on this at a later blog.
