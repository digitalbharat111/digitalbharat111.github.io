Yes, this is exactly what, I have always been searching for. I am sure you must be too. You might have read and seen many people who are successful in the fields of interest. Everyone aspires to be a success. 

"Success", The world has been so obsessed about, that not only one always wants to be successful but also the whole family and society pushes you, motivates you, and expects you to be. I was given examples of several successful people many times by parents, teachers, and friends to motivate me and get me to be one of those who are successful.  I know many of us faced this in our lives. But is following successful people, their life stories, reading their biographies is enough to be successful? For me, it wasn't enough as I have read success stories of many, but I don't think I have achieved anything even close to them. 

A few years back, when I was looking everywhere for information, ideas, and opportunities to be successful, I came across a video on youtube. The video's title was enough to catch my attention, "AAG Hi AAG". I saw the video and was immediately impressed by the way the speaker in the video was presenting the subject on a stage to around 2,000 people in an auditorium. He said, " I have been searching for the single formula/secret for success" and to understand the same he read several books met many successful people across the world, and found a common denominator to success.

Of course, it is exciting to be able to get to know the formula for success, would you like to know what the speaker, "Mr. Santosh Nair" said? 

Here it is, He says " HABIT"
