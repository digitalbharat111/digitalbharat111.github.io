**Reading is a wonderful habit.**

Reading helps not only to learn a topic or a subject but also to immerse yourself and get into a whole different world or even deep into ourselves and understand "Self", better.

My Reading journey like all children begun in school. Especially when an additional part was introduced in English subject, the Non-detail. This contained bunch of stories and later even the complete book was a story.

I got introduced to several lovely stories through this subject like The Hound of Baskervilles, The Moonstone, Trojan War and after, Guillver Travels, and a few more. 

I was thoroughly impressed by the character of Sherlock Holmes created by Arthur Conan Doyle, The Hound of Baskervilles was so intriguing and interesting to read through, which I did several times. later I read a lot of books related to Sherlock Holmes, my all-time favorite detective. I am sure this character inspired much youth to become a detective.

"Trojan War and After" is a book based on Greek Mythology about the greatest war the world has ever seen which included Gods and Men on either side. Thoroughly enjoyed the larger-than-life characters of course instantly became a fan of Achilles. I must have read that book several times in my school tenure. So impressed was I by this book that later after around 10 years of leaving school, I purchased the book from a second-hand books store and again read the same several times, before watching the movie "Troy" made on the same.

That initial interest later occupied most of my free time during my Naval training and especially sailing life onboard a Survey Ship which was mostly sailing throughout the year. Read many books by Sidney Sheldon, Jeffrey Archer, John Grisham, Robert Ludlum, Dan Brown, enjoyed reading every book. During that time even read books of Chetan Bhagat, APJ Abdul Kalam (related)also. 

Later, a friend suggested reading fiction (Self-help as I called them) books, so I wasn't interested. He then gave me a storybook. As soon as I opened it, it took me back to my childhood days simple children's story book. By the time I finished the book enjoying the lovely little story, I felt that it was a wonderful book on change management (Who Moved my Cheese ? - Spencer Johnson)

This book changed my way of seeing life. Then started reading a different genre of books like The Present, The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari, The Alchemist, Fountainhead, Zahir, etc.,
