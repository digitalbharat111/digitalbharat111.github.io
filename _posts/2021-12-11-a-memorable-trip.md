Life is said to be a journey and it is all about finding your destination. Apart from that going out and traveling to a known destination is great. The purpose of a trip might be anything but the memories made during the same are the ones that remain. 

Traveling has been part of my life and the travel/trip from which i remember is the one I took to leave my home and join the defense at the age of 16 years, from then on I have traveled several times to various places, mostly alone, with friends and family too. 

The one trip I am sure is going to be a sweet memory is the most recent one I took with my whole family and as is said, " The best trips are the ones without any clear plan".

Last month my parents visited my place ( Thiruvananthapuram). My brother also reached here with his family (his wife and his two lovely sons). As there were heavy rains here most of the last month and my brother's office (work from home). I was not clear where to take them around in Kerala.  

I was supposed to travel to Kochi for a meeting on 2nd Nov which I knew would last only three to four hours at the most. I planned to take a day's leave to attend the meeting and be back the same day. I informed same to my wife on the 29th evening (Friday). My brother who was working in the other room immediately joined my wife and together their response was, " How come you are planning to go alone, we would all come with you".

There started the plan for the trip at 2200 hrs and in the next one hour, we decided we may travel to Kanyakumari the next morning and come back or may visit Kochi from there itself and visit see around the city. Within no time the place again changed as my brother wanted to visit Munnar. 

Finally, after several discussions, we have decided we will go Kochi and from there visit Munnar and on return tour Kochi and be back. The reservations to go to Kochi the next day were done immediately. This happened at 0030 hrs(12:30 a.m). The next morning as soon as parents woke up informed them to get ready to leave on a trip for 4-5 days. The kids were surely excited to hear this. 

The train journey to Kochi started at around 01:00 p.m and by around 6 p.m we reached there. After check-in into a hotel, all of us went out to the Marine drive, a place, where I used to regularly hang out with friends, some 16 years back, this time with my family. Memories were rushing in. was excited like a  kid, showing the places where we used to sit around, views all around, the sea view, the shopping complex, it was such a nice experience. The icing on the cake was the dinner we had at 'Punjab House" a sixty-year-old restaurant that serves authentic Punjabi food. Everyone loved the food there. Enjoyed it and returned to the hotel. 

In the morning, we left for Munnar,  which is 126 km from Kochi. Initially, it was the simple greenery around and the little traffic as it was Sunday morning. The route soon turned into the hills of Kannan Devan the entire landscape from then on was amazing. The thick and dense green forests, the beautiful houses, and the small, waterfalls all seemed to welcome us to the entrance of heaven. Nature was at its best and was taken care of. Soon we were part of the clouds. The visibility was so low due to thick fog and the view down the valley was breathtaking. Tea plantations on either side and awesome greenery were a sight to behold. Once we reached Munnar we checked into a beautiful hotel with a mesmerizing view of the valley and the river passing by. 

The tour began on Jeep to the spices garden, " The Kerala Farm" which is developed in around 500 acres of land, home to thousands of species of medicinal and spice plants. A tour has been arranged within 3 acres to show around and explain the benefits and usage of a few medicinal plants. The medicines store, where pure ayurvedic medicines, spices, and tea/ coffee were available for purchase. The tour was very informative and interesting. We then visited the Homemade Chocolate store, a treasure for children with various flavors of chocolates.

The next day started with a visit to the tea plantations, Elephant rides, The Echo point, The Wonderland (Adventure park), Flower gardens, The Hydel power project, pedal boating, and Attukkal Waterfalls. Every place and activity was fun and lovely especially when all the family members enjoyed it a lot.

Again we had a change of plan to visit Alleppey rather than Kochi from there. Leaving behind tonnes of memories and the heartwarming beauty of nature, we left for Alleppey. The next morning we boarded a houseboat. luckily due to non-weekend day (Tuesday) and a friend's help, we could find a houseboat which was occupied by our family itself. Such a pleasant backwater boat ride, so close to nature and our complete family. Children danced till they were fully tired and we all had a good time and the delicious food made with the fresh catch of fish and crabs was mouth-watering.

Finally, the night stay with complete darkness around in between the water, and open sky was an experience so wonderful. 

We returned home the next day. That was one memorable trip. What made this trip special was the presence of complete family and the kids. Looking forward to many more such lovely moments and travels.
