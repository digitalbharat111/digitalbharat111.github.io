There was once a time when it looked as only a few companies can succeed in a particular field as they were market leaders or Brand Leaders.

You must remember how a few years back there were many soft drink companies but then and even now two Brands stood out "COCA-COLA" and "PEPSI". Similar is the case with several other segments of the industry.
Today branding is not just limited to goods and accessories, gadgets, etc.


Products belonging to certain brands were bound to sell and are assumed to be the best option irrespective of their cost or quality. With the rapid growth in technology, the market trends have been changing and now people are more aware of various other factors to decide on buying a product.

The brand once established in the market and makes sure that people can connect with it is bound to stay for long and enjoy the market share till the time the brand continues to maintain the relation with the customer. We have many times come across instances where the brand name is so attached to the product that it is considered to be the name of the product itself. 

Few examples of the same are as follows:-

1) We always ask the shopkeeper for a xerox of the papers whereas we need the photostat copies of the same and XEROX was the company who launched this service.

2) You have seen people asking for Colgate of a particular size or cost when they need toothpaste.

Dettol for an anti-septic solution, Burnol for burn care, Maggi for noodles, Parachute for Hair Oil, Lux for bath soap, etc.,

You must have also observed that people generally like to hear from people rather than brands. It is where Personal Branding came into the role. Today we see and hear the impact of personal branding in almost all fields. The Movies which could earn a few crores in a particular region could get to enter a different continent as people around connect to the Stars related to the movie, be the Director, Producer, Music Director, Singer and in most of the cases, The Lead Actress or Lead Actor. Just because a person connects to one of these aspects of the movie he or she is willing to spend money to watch it. So the brand value of the persons involved in the project will directly affect the result. 

I have learned from Digital Deepak, as he branded himself, a process for creating a personal brand. This process holds good for people from any background and age who want to enter a business or a startup or make big in their particular field. A brand is all about the trust people have in it. The more the people and the more they trust, the bigger and successful the Brand. This concept is explained by "DD" as Mass Trust. The blueprint to Mass Trust as shared and explained by Digital Deepak himself is as follows: - 

Learn a new skill, any skill, if worked upon continuously and mastered can make wonders happen.
Work as an employee or as a Freelancer to understand and learn the skill deeper and better.
Build your Brand through writing, Writing helps you understand the concept better, show others your mastery of a particular skill, share knowledge, let people into your world of knowledge, this can be from a starting stage of writing content for others to blogs to content creation as a freelancer to ebooks to a successful author of a best selling book.
Consult: Sell advice based on your experience, This can you monetize from your skills and understand the market need better, and make good contacts. 
Mentor: Guide other people to follow your strategy. The experience gained from learning, freelancing, writing can help someone to learn. A mentor can impact the way of thinking of his pupil/ followers. 
Startup: Build a startup from your experience. The market need once understood through interaction with the market especially while freelancing and mentoring can very well help you design a product that is market fit and can sell itself or even market a product that suits the market need with the help of your brand. This is the best time to build a startup.
