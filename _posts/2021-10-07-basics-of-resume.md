A resume is the first thing an individual prepares before applying for any. Your resume is the first look about you to a company in which you have applied for a job. 

How important is it for a Resume to be great or perfect?

In general, it is understood that a resume is to contain brief information of the personal details, academic qualifications, professional experience of any, future aspirations, etc.
But experts suggest that one might be wrong in thinking so. 

When as an individual, your whole personal introduction as to your abilities and suitability for a particular job is needed to be judged firsthand by means of a two-page resume, the content of the same needs to be perfect.

Many of us tend to prepare a resume and then circulate the same to several companies for several suitable jobs. Which might absolutely be wrong. The chances of making the best first impression of an employer are by tailoring your resume as to the job applied for. Any unnecessary information or unclear information undermines the value of the resume, thereby the candidate. In many cases, if presented perfectly, the resume can guarantee a job, and even if an individual is called up for an interview an added advantage of the perfect resume helps. 

I would like to quote an example of a resume I came across the net a few years back and was thoroughly impressed by the same. the reason that this resume might help as guidance or outline as to how an amazing resume can be, I would like to share its link. www.nina4airbnb.com.The website in itself is self-explanatory and mind-blowing.

If a resume can also be presented to a company as to where do you see yourself fit into the future plans of the company and how you are the right candidate for the job, the chances of getting through are much high. Gone are those days when jobs would be just offered seeing the academic scores and certificates. Every company out there is looking for the best value for the money spent on the right candidate.  Also, the fact that once the resumes were made with the help of individuals working at internet cafes' and now there is an increase in the number of professional resume validators, resume Builders, Resume Analysers, etc.
