Having a great day today, learning something new.
I have started a lot of new things in my life. 
Many times out of excitement and out of serious thinking of changing my life sometimes.

but I have to agree that most of the projects I have started, I never completed.
Not so proud of it but that's not going to stop me from starting something new again.

Writing as such I believe is a very useful practice. I believe it helps us understand the concept about which we are writing in a deeper sense. clears ur thinking process. Also helps build on the knowledge already gained. 

Everyone gains knowledge abut few things either m=by experience or studying or hearing from others. to share the knowledge is a nice thing. Especially if it benefits us. It is a bonus if we can write to help others understand a concept, teach, inspire, motivate and guide.
