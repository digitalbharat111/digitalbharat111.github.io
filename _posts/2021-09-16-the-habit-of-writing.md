We all learn to Read and Write in our childhood itself.

Slowly schooling mostly becomes reading and writing.
Reading out the lessons, writing down the notes. Reading the questions and answers again to memorize mostly rather than to understand, as we are expected t answer the question verbally at an early age and later in the written form.

However, it is never taught as to the other benefits of writing. Rather the reason why we are writing.

The education system fed us that writing has to be of a particular way and fr a particular purpose.

The exercises are given for practicing writing, especially essays n various topics were to be to the point of Introduction / Main Body and summarisation/conclusion. 

But little did we knew then that the habit of writing is the most important aspect of learning more importantly the thinking process.

once the thinking process is set than reading, understanding, writing, improvising everything falls into place.

Few prominent psychologists suggest that a person who masters the skill of Writing, Reading and Speaking has all the possibilities of succeeding in any task and rather in life.

Writing after reading a tpic or hearing a topic, helps us understand the areas where we are clear and strong and where we are weak. Helping in guiding us twards understanign a tpis/ aspect better.

In this world of rapid growth with ideas and learning frm all directions being bombarded onto an individual, writing slows down the thinking process and gives clarity. 

The process of writing also helps in arranging the thoughts in aprticular order and also t plan sequence of actions to be fllwed to achieve a particular task or a goal.

practicing the art of writing also gives mastery on the subject. A whole dtaabase of your knwoledge and thoughts. Over a perid of time the clarity and precision of wrting imprves making the material sharp and crisp to the pint and interesting and easy t understand.
