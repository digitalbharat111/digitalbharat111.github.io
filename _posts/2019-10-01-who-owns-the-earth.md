Earth is the only known planet in the Solar System to have an ecology to support life. The Blue Planet. 

Let's not get into Who created this Earth and stuff like that. But trying to understand, the concept that Earth and its Ecological system is a wonder in itself. It is home to millions of living organisms. The Flora and the Fauna. Human Beings of course are the best of the creation and declare themselves to be on top of the food chain and the rightful owners of this planet. 

But How far is this true?

Years of study and understanding by several experts and scientists only proves the theory that the Ecosystem as we call in simple language as nature, runs on unwritten rules and principles and all living beings on the Earth are to follow these for peaceful coexistence.

Humans however thanks to their thinking ability found a pang of hunger in themselves to grow, initially to fulfill their basic needs and wants and desires as explained in various theories. Evolution is part of nature and everything in existence in nature has evolved based on its surroundings. Evolution occurs naturally in a biological sense too. like the Giraffe's long neck to reach leaves at heights, A camel's Thick Eyelids to protect itself from the desert sand storms, Its capacity to hold reserves for water to overcome the harsh desert conditions, its hoofs suiting to the sands, and many such evolutions even in humans from monkeys losing the fur and the tail to the ability to use our spine to walk erect. 

Talking about evolution in nature, Humans have been evolving mentally too, starting from becoming a social animal building family and then tribes, communicating, through teamwork learning and creating, discovering and always self-evolving. But in a huge ecosystem that is in place despite different features, is only possible with maintaining a perfect balance among all the elements in the system.

The rapid changes by the ever-evolving human minds have brought many rapid changes to the Earth's ecosystem.
