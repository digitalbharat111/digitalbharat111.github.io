**Every person dreams of Job security.** 

This has become the basis of education. A good level of education is said to be a must to achieve Job Security. Without which the society considered one as a failure / struggling in life.

Right from the early '90s or maybe even before that Government jobs were considered to provide Job Security. Agriculture has been the backbone of our nation. But this philosophy of Jobs and a secure life has forced people to not let their next generation follow Agriculture and gain access to a secure job and a secure life.

In the early years of this millennium at the start of around 2000, there has been a rise in the demand for Software Professionals. India has a huge number of educated as well as unemployed youth, did everything to cash in this boom.

Suddenly youth from any background could aspire to make a living abroad and families enjoyed the fruits of children settled abroad. So, people found a new alternative to the unbreakable demand of very less availability of Government jobs. 

Several such fields emerged giving various options for so-called high-earning jobs which are understood to be even important than Government jobs. One such is the Marine Industry, namely the Merchant navy. This field too offered hefty packages even though they require men to be away from their families for several months in a year, all through their career.

Little did we realize that all that glitters isn't gold.

We have seen that the world has grown into a Global village and many industries are interdependent on social, political, and economic conditions worldwide. As when there was a slowdown, and financial crisis in one part of the world the whole world came crashing down.

Millions of people lost their hard-earned well-paying jobs in a flash. Forcing them to return to their countries and villages and search for entry into the already heavily crowded job markets. Bursting the bubble of Job Security again.

##What is Job Security?

A question we must have asked ourselves longtime back.

The job basically solves the financial requirement to run a family. The nature/level of the job a person qualifies for depends on the skillset and qualifications. As the main purpose of a job is to provide financial help one prefers a high-paying one. As time passed by and millions lost jobs due to external factors which had nothing to do with their self-performance or qualifications and skills, another factor arose linking to the security of the job itself.

That is why the huge never-ending demand for Government jobs in our country. 

As these jobs assure that once a person enters a job at a particular level as per the laid down rules increments, promotions and further benefits are given and are paid until they attain an age of 60 years and even after retiring from job provisions are made to provide financial and healthcare benefits as pension.

Most of us are aware of all these issues. Also, we are all aware of the benefits of jobs and the importance of Job Security.

Shall we even discuss then, What is it that we lose or give away in order to get and be in these jobs?

Many and most of the jobs require your complete dedication to a good part of your daily life, some also drastically affecting the rest of your life. Be it the Stressful work, working conditions, performance pressure, work culture, etc. So after a few months into a particular job, people tend to mold their lifestyle, social circle, activities, and future plans to that job. As a result, there is always a hidden pressure in oneself not to lose this job as it becomes their way of life or life itself.

This is seeming to be even deeper a subject to discuss. But in this article I hope, I could just highlight the fact that "Job Security" as we have been thinking of, is just a myth.

As the essential purpose of a Job as I mentioned in the beginning, is the biggest cause of insecurity and stress in people's lives today.
