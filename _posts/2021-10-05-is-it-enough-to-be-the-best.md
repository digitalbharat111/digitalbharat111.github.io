Every Individual, as well as every business out there, aspires to be the best. Being the best is what drives individuals and organizations to break their barriers and work hard, even push their limits to be the "Best".

Let me take you to the childhood days when you were expected to be the best in everything you do, and this was made clear by parents, relatives, teachers, and even friends. That being the "Best" in whatever we do is of prime importance. And so the struggle begins in schools the education system is made such to choose the best of children in various fields but particularly in academics. The Best of the students was supposedly the one with the highest marks in all the subjects where there is no particular benchmark of being the best. In earlier days passing the class and moving ahead was considered enough but times changed, and competition grew. When I was in school, 25 years ago, around 80 percentile was enough to be in the best place.

Topping your school was the best thing that a student could do, and it was considered enough for a bright future ahead. But the same individuals who topped their schools after reaching their choice of Institutions for professional courses learned that only the best out of them, Topper of the institution, only has bright chances of a successful career. The number of institutions grew, increasing the number of toppers. Now again, as we know that the ever-growing competition is pushing the limits, recently it has been seen that more than few candidates score 100 percent. But still is not enough to get the desired seat for higher education or a job. 


Not only is this happening to students but also businesses. Many businesses, considered to be best in their particular field and market, are now wiped out of the market. Businesses' that enjoyed market leader positions once are no more the same. The Biggest and the best of their fields could not escape the brutal hits of the market.

Nokia, Yahoo, MGM Studios, Kingfisher Airlines, Kodak, Orkut, Ambassador, Jet Airways are just a few examples from the never-ending list of Giants to Rags. 

Now, if you try to understand this a little deeper, this downfall even happened to countries. There might be many on the list. Venezuela is an apt example. The Once rich and developed country with "Best" of all, immense wealth and successful people in various fields, also a supplier of crude oil for the world. In the fashion industry, this country was famous for the Best models and many beauty pageants. A country that had everything that's needed to be the Best and provides a rich, happy and successful life to its people. Today its economy is shattered and its people are hopeless of any better future. All this happened only in a matter of a decade or so. 

So, is being the Best enough? Not. But being the best version of yourself every day in overall development is a must.
