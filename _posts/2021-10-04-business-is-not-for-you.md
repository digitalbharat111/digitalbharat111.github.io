Our education system is designed to prepare students to clear exams for higher studies and then to clear exams related to government jobs. 
Mugging up stuff throughout their school life which is never related to the professional life ahead is draining the energy of the students and the money of the parents. Several surveys show that the students coming out of the Indian Education system are not Industry Ready. The lessons and years of study are all but of no use at all, which is a big flaw. 

There is not much teaching or learning in schools regarding the purpose of a particular subject and its practical implementation and impact on society. Financial knowledge is nowhere included at the school level and colleges are also not even discussed much in Professional courses. This resulting in the school and college toppers failing badly in their professional life. 

The only target given to the students by teachers as well as parents is to find the best "Job". High paying, huge respect, career progression, Abroad opportunities are what are focused on. That is the reason why Graduates with Technical degrees and even Post Graduates are seen applying for multi-tasking posts in government services, as an option of a secure job and career. Even though you have seen several examples of various people breaking barriers in the field of setting up their businesses that made a huge impact and revolutionized a particular service or sector, One cannot think of starting a business today. 


The reason being the social taboos accosted with it. The uncertainties and risks involved in setting up growing a business are highlighted in such magnitude that even the thought of entering this field is considered foolish, careless, and is understood to be overconfidence and arrogance, most of the time in most of the societies. A well-educated person working in underpaying job, struggling his whole life is considered and hard-working and respectable person. Whereas a person of the same qualifications and background as soon as he/she even think of entering a business even the closer relatives never encourage and rather do their best to bring the person back to the so-called normal life, which is a place where dreams and murdered and caliber and hunger to grow is trampled into the dirt and the person pushed into the never-ending life of rat race.


People are ready to spend huge amounts of money in marriages, family functions, relatives pleasing, social status up-gradation (clothes, gadgets, house, etc,.) Some even invest money in buying excess gold for marriages of kids, land, flats, etc.,
