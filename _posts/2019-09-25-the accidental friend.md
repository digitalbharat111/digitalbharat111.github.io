Friendship is such a sweet relation we make with others which sometimes becomes more meaningful and strong than the relations we are born and live with.

One such friendship I found in 2005 In God Own Country (Kerala), Kochi.

In one of our routine sailing at sea near the coast of Kochi, I was on my bed with my bunk light on and was deep into a lovely book, "Fountain Head" by Ayn Rand. It was around 2200hrs (10 p.m). There was a sudden announcement which was for me asking me to come to the bridge. I wasn't sure what it was that needed my attention so late in the night. As soon as I reached The Bridge ( Command Centre of the ship) The Executive Officer was serious;y giving out instructions to a few officers and men. I knew immediately that something was wrong. There was a Sailing Yacht in crisis nearby and raised a "May Day". I had to lower one the SMB (Survey Motor Boat) for some crew to reach a sailing yacht to rescue them.

All were in action and the team with a medical officer reached the yacht and found two men injured and the yacht was hit by a passing ship and broke its mast. Both the men on the sailing yacht were brought onboard for treatment and I saw a young man accompanying a very old man who dislocated his shoulder and was slightly injured.

The next day morning they were dropped at the harbor and their yacht was towed to the nearest Jetty as far I was concerned, my role in this scene was over. But, Little did I know it was going to become so much a part of my life forever. The third day after the incident I was again called upon by the Commanding Officer and was informed that I have been assigned to communicate with the foreign crew of the sailing yacht and get it repaired by the local traders. Being a Naval Architect, I understood Boats, their construction, etc., 


So I went out to see the sailing yacht and meet its crew. It was a magnificent boat, even though its mast was broken and the foxle was damaged and few guardrails were out of place due to the hit. Its Nam even was Unique, "Sir George". I saw the local traders and heard the old man shouting at them not to touch anything and spoil or damage it more. it looked that the Old man was angry and frustrated.
