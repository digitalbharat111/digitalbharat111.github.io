OPPORTUNITIES - ARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE READY

Everything in life happens for a reason. 

It is right and it is equally true that everyone is given opportunities to make meaning out of their lives.

irrespective of where a person is born, which social background the person belongs to. Of course, only a few ever achieved their dreams and reached milestones in their respective fields. 

Have you wondered why it is so?

Often the circumstances, people in the family, the friends, the society as a whole are blamed by a person who did not succeed in life. But little do they realize that all the reasons are excuses and not related to their success. 

Everyone is born equal and is equally equipped and has a fair to choose their path and make their mark. Even though few might have some of the other physical or mental disabilities, but as is studies and realized upon no one is disable just that some are differently-abled. 

Disabled are only those who do not realize their true purpose and potential. Once an individual is clear of his purpose and has determined a path or a field to succeed, there is no stopping. The history of mankind is filled with many such examples where a determined heart made the impossible and unthinkable achievable. 

A person's achievement is as memorable and sweet as tough the difficulties were in the path to success. Also helps break the barriers in the mindsets of the rest which hold them back.

It was thought to be impossible for humans to ever leave earth. Humans stepped on Moon, walked in space, started living for months together, and even on the way to step on to other planets.

Until the time a milestone is achieved it is believed upon as impossible and unachievable but once it is reached, Humans' thirst for more pushes the boundaries constantly.

We need to realize that every being has its purpose and is in here to its specific destination. One can't just compare and blindly follow a course of others. 

Human beings are for sure the best of the living things ever created. Only for those who are clear of this concept and ready to explore their paths and ready to take upon their journey there are opportunities everywhere.

There is no field where greatness cannot be achieved.
