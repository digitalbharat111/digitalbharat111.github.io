Writing is one of the earliest skills we learn in our childhood. However, like any other skill, the benefits of writing also are never-ending and depend on how effectively is it used.

As a child writing is fun, and then to be able to write exactly the way we are expected is a difficult process that we undergo with the help and guidance from parents, siblings, and teachers. At a later stage, writing in various languages and writing in a certain way is focused upon. The need of it at that stage is to be able to store the answers being taught at school which can be learned at home and be re-written when and where we are asked to.

Writing has many more benefits and has a deeper impact on a person and society at large. As an individual, we come up with random thoughts all the time even though we are already involved in a different task. This generally leads to forgetting those random thoughts, that if worked upon had the potential to change the course of actions and maybe even your future.
