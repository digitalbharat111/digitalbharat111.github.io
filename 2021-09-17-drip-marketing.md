**Marketing as we know is ever-evolving.**

Email marketing is one of the branches of marketing. wherein the target audience/customer is given the necessary information firstly to make them aware of your brand and may even provide them a " Call To Action" option to close the sale.

It is not generally feasible to expect the new users to decide to purchase your product (or take required action) based on a single Email, how effective and attractive it might be.

This is where the term "Drip Marketing" comes into the scene.

##Drip marketing - 
A term related to agriculture, where irrigation is done in the drip method. Water is supplied t the crop at regular intervals in controlled quantities making it ideal for the best growth. This type of irrigation proved to have better results fiving maximum ROI.

Now following a similar trend where Brands keep touching/interacting with the audience regularly and repeatedly to mark a mark on them, to build trust and familiarise them with the brand and thereby the present and the future products.

Similarly, Drip Marketing is done using a sequence of emails to the email accounts gained as leads through various lead magnets like surveys, forms, free ebooks, free subscriptions, etc., 

The emails are spaces and sequenced to let the target audience become aware of the scope of your product in their lives systematically. rather than making the interaction bring and one sided. making them understand it better and then by providing the information establishing your authority on the product. Building trust and preparing them to purchase the product. When the target audience is aware of the product, its impact, and usefulness in their lives and has prepared themselves to g ahead and get the product, the sale happens naturally and even leads to repeated sales, etc.,

Several tools help in generating/capturing leads. If the leads are then fed with the right information and nurtured properly using "Drip Marketing", any small business can be scaled.
